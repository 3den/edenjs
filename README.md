## What is Spice.js?

Spice is a super minimal (< 3k) and flexible MVC framework for javascript. Spice was built to be easily added to any existent application and play well with other technologies such as jQuery, pjax, turbolinks, node or whatever else you are using.

### Why yet an other MVC framework?

Currently all major MVC frameworks for javascript have a huge APIs and you end up writing more code to satisfy the the framework requirements than your own business logic, that leads to code that is tightly coupled to the framework and hard to reuse, sometimes even hard to update for new versions of the framework.

On Spice most of the code you write is pure javascript the framework API is minimal (just 5 methods) that helps you to make your code easier to reuse and test. The core of Spice is pure javascript (without any external dependency) that is fully unit tested and can be easily extended.

Spice.js was inspired by [the SOLID Principles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design)), [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) and [Riot.js](https://github.com/muut/riotjs).
